The largest bug that I've have is that I can't do statements like the one below:
(+ (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2)) 

It will only evaluate the first expession (+ 1 1). It works for all other cases
so this will throw off many of the test cases so please be kind!

"let" also does not work completly but it's late and I have work in a couple of 
hours...
